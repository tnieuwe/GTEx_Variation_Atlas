```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(HPAStainR)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(hpar)
library(stringr)
```

Load in data

```{r}
clust_genes <- read.csv(file = "../data_out/labels_and_genes.csv")
```

Load in hpar data
```{r}
data("hpaNormalTissue")

```


This is the HPAStainR loop it should only be rarely ran as it is not optimized for this type of analysis.
Later analyses will just load the output rda file from t his analysis.
```{r}

clust_list <- as.list(str_split(clust_genes[,2], ";"))
names(clust_list) <- clust_genes[,1]

all_stainr <-  lapply(clust_list, function(x) {
      #hpa_res <- HPAStainR(gene_list = x, hpa_dat = hpaNormalTissue,cancer_analysis = "normal")
      tryCatch(assign("hpa_res", HPAStainR(gene_list = x, hpa_dat = hpaNormalTissue,cancer_analysis = "normal")),
               error = browser)
      if (!("detected_proteins" %in% colnames(hpa_res))) {
         return(NA)
      }
      hpa_res <- filter(hpa_res, !is.na(detected_proteins))
      return(hpa_res)
    })
